    "In the Python cell below:\n",
    "1. Create an empty list where you will subsequently store your matrix.\n",
    "2. Use `range()` to generate a list of numbers that begin each row of the matrix. Save the result in a variable called `begin_numbers`; you will use it later to generate the row of your table. Remeber that Python adds `+1` when counting, so make sure `stop` is correct. (*Hint:* your list should be: [1, 6, 11]. What are the values of `start`, `stop`, and `step` that you need to enter in order to get such a list?\n",
    "3. Use a `for` loop to go through `begin_numbers`. As you go through the loop, use `range()` again to generate that row of the table. For example, the first element in `begin_numbers[1]` can be used to generate the first row of the table (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`). Once you've generated the row, save it in the matrix using the `append()` function. (This needs to be done in the `for` loop!)\n",
    "4. Finally, print your completed matrix.\n",
    "5. When your code is working properly, save a copy of this .ipynb file in the format \"Lab5\" + your name, and submit it on Blackboard for credit.\n",
